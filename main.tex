\begin{abstract}
The Wright-Fisher and Moran models are Markov processes, where discrete population allele frequencies are iterated forward in time by multiplication with a transition matrix, modeling population genetic forces (\eg\ mutation, selection, and drift). For large population sizes, iteration can be replaced by continuous diffusion. Data are typically aligned sequences of a sample of individuals from one or more populations from the present. In highly recombining regions, sites can be assumed to evolve independently, such that the entire information is contained in the site frequency spectrum of a single population (SFS) or the joint site frequency spectrum (jSFS) of many populations. The task is to infer population genetic parameters or the population history from the data. With forward processes, \ie\ the Wright-Fisher, the Moran, or the forward diffusion models, population allele frequency distributions in and out of equilibrium may be obtained. These can be combined with the likelihoods of an SFS to obtain joint distributions of sample and population allele frequencies. By integrating out population allele frequencies, population genetic parameters may be obtained from the marginal likelihoods. Backward processes consist of, in the discrete case, iteration of the transpose of the transition matrix or, in the continuous case, of the backward diffusion equation. Combining the forward and backward processes, as in the forward-backward algorithm of hidden Markov models, the probability distribution of population allele frequencies can be inferred at all times in the past. Additionally, marginal likelihoods of samples from multiple populations that split in the past, \ie\ of a jSFS, may be obtained.

\section{Introduction}

Most basic population genetic models, \eg\ the Wright-Fisher and the Moran models as well as the forward and backward diffusion models \citep[reviewed in][]{Ewen04}, were introduced before DNA sequence data became available. Thus, emphasis was on demonstrating processes over time and on qualitatively explaining observations, rather than on quantitative inference of population genetic parameters given molecular data. On the other hand, coalescent theory \citep{King82} was used both for demonstration of processes as well as for inference given a population sample \citep{Hein05,Wake09}. With coalescence, the history of a particular sample is reconstructed, however the aim in population genetics is most often the inference of the evolutionary trajectory of the whole population.

In regions of relatively high recombination rates compared to mutation rates, sites may be assumed to evolve independently. Usually, mutation rates are low such that most sites in, \eg\ \textit{Drosophila} or mammal population samples are monomorphic (fixed), while only two bases segregate at polymorphic sites. Therefore, most genomic sites are bi-allelic with respect to their nucleotide composition or when compared to an ancestral state. %Population data are usually represented as a site frequency spectrum (SFS) for a single population or a joint site frequency spectrum (jSFS), for two populations that split some time in the past.

Typically, the data $Y$ are from the present time and consist of an alignment of $M$ sequences (randomly drawn from a population) across $L$ sites. Such a dataset can be represented as an SFS whose likelihood can be calculated given the present population allele frequency $X_0$ and a probability model describing the sampling process. The distribution of $X_0$ is in turn given by a population genetic model parametrized by, \eg\ the scaled mutation rate $\theta=N\mu$, the mutation bias $\alpha$, or the selection strength $\gamma=Ns$ \citep[as defined in][]{Vogl15}. Integrating over all values of $X_0$, the marginal likelihood $\Pr(Y\given \alpha,\theta,\gamma)$ may be obtained and maximum likelihood inference of population genetic parameters is possible under the assumption of equilibrium \citep{Vogl14b,Vogl15}. This strategy may also be viewed as the empirical Bayes method \citep[\eg][]{Carl00}. 

Maximum likelihood inference is more complicated with data from two or more populations that split some time in the past, \ie\ with a jSFS. Models iterating forward in time, \eg\ the Wright-Fisher, Moran or continuous diffusion models, have rarely been used for this task. An exception is the forward iteration of a Moran model in phylogenetic inference \citep{Schrempf2016}. In this case, summation over all $N+1$ ancestral states is necessary at each node, \ie\ at each binary split into two populations. Such summation becomes difficult with large $N$. Therefore, mutation rates are scaled such that $N$ can be taken small. Note that sample sizes $M$ can be large for sequence data from pooled individuals or from many populations and information is inevitably lost if $M>N$. Therefore, such data are  difficult to analyze accurately with forward methods. %Note that diagonalization of the transition matrix is necessary for numerical efficiency. %CV: I would want to leave Zhao14 in the intro, lest we only introducing our own research!
%Moreover,
\citet{Zhao14} provide a forward algorithm based on the Wright-Fisher model, where probabilities of intermediate states are calculated conditional on the starting and end states. This allows for simulation of trajectories. 

Backward processes can be used to calculate the likelihood of the data $Y$ conditional on the population allele frequency $X_t$  at earlier times ($t<0$). %allow pushing the conditioning on the population allele frequency backward in time, \ie\ they allow calculation of the likelihood $\Pr(Y\given X_t, \dots)$ with $t<0$.
In the discrete case, the process consists of iterating the transpose of the forward transition matrix; in the continuous case, a solution to the backwards diffusion equation is needed.
%They consist of, in the discrete case, iteration of the transpose of the forward transition matrix; in the continuous case, of the backward diffusion equation.
Combining the forward and backward processes in the forward-backward algorithm of hidden Markov models (HMM) \citep{Rabi86}, the probability distribution of population allele frequencies conditional on data $\Pr(X_t\given Y,\dots)$ can be inferred at time $t$ in the past and the distribution of trajectories may be simulated. This may be an aim in itself \citep{Zhao14}. Additionally, it is  possible to calculate the marginal likelihoods of samples from multiple splitting populations, \ie\ from a jSFS, by integrating out the population allele frequencies.

In this article, we use forward and backward processes to conveniently calculate the probability odistirbution of $X_t$ forward and backward in time conditional on the SFS or the jSFS from the present. %In discrete time, this corresponds to a variant of the forward-backward algorithm \citep{Rabi86}. The method can also be used to calculate likelihoods of jSFS. 
Furthermore, we introduce bi-allelic population genetic models, with mutations occurring only at fixed sites, that are variants of the infinite site or Poisson-random-fields models \citep{Kimu69,Sawy92}. The Markov chains of the models under consideration have no absorbing states and therefore have stationary distributions. However, we do not always assume time-reversibility. For the discrete models, transition matrices have to be multiplied. For large population sizes, this is more cumbersome than solving the corresponding Kolmogorov forward and backward diffusion equations using orthogonal polynomials. With mutation and drift only, orthogonal polynomials provide a flexible and fast method to calculate marginal likelihoods for inference in population genetics.

\section{Time-homogeneous discrete Markov chains}

In this section we apply the forward-backward algorithm to discrete population genetic models for inference given an SFS or jSFS. To this purpose, we rephrase iteration using discrete population genetic models (Wright-Fisher or Moran) in the terminology of the forward-backward algorithm. We mainly use matrix notation to emphasize the similarities between discrete iteration and continuous models in Sections~\ref{diffDer} and~\ref{forwBackDiff}. Many subsections review standard theory, but are included for completeness and clarity. 

\subsection{Assumptions}\label{section:assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Assume a population of large (effective) size $N$ and some bi-allelic mutation model. The time-dependent frequency of allele zero in the population is denoted $\x{t}$ ($0 \le \x{t} \le N$) and is assumed to evolve as a discrete, time-homogeneous Markov chain with a transition probability matrix $\mathbf{T}$, where $(T_{ij})_{i,j \in \{0, \ldots, N\}} = \Pr(\x{t+1}=j \given \x{t}=i)$. $\mathbf{T}$ is an irreducible, aperiodic, right stochastic matrix.
\item At a (possibly unknown) time $t=\s$ ($\s<0$) in the past, a distribution of population allelic proportions is given by $\bs{\rho}$ with entries $(\rho_{i})_{i \in \{0, \ldots, N\}} = \Pr(\x{\s}=i)$.  In particular, $\bs{\rho}$ may be the stationary distribution of the forward process $\bs{\pi}=(\pi_i)_{i \in \{0, \ldots, N\}}$ or may correspond to a joint distribution of some other data and the equilibrium allele frequency distribution. 
\item The population evolves until the present time $t=0$, when a sample of size $M$ is drawn.  We denote the sampled frequency of allele zero as $\y$ ($0 \le \y \le M$). The likelihood of observing $\y$ is given by $\Pr(\y \given M, \x{0})$ (we may leave away the dependency on $M$ in the following) and will be defined according to the application.
\end{enumerate}

For two populations, assumptions (ii) and (iii) are modified:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item At a (possibly unknown) time $t=\s$ ($\s<0$) in the past,  $\x{\s}$ is drawn from a distribution of population allelic proportions $\bs{\rho}$. The population separates immediately into two populations with the same initial allele frequency $\x{\s}$. 
\item The two populations evolve independently until the present time $t=0$, when samples of sizes $M_1$ and $M_2$ are drawn from each population.
\end{enumerate}

For discrete models, iteration is more efficient if the population size $N$ is small. $N$ can be decreased by increasing the mutation rate $\mu$ such that $\theta=N \mu$ remains constant. For moderate $N$, the error introduced by scaling is small and converges to $0$ in the diffusion limit $N \to \infty$. Therefore, $N$ is usually set according to numerical convenience. %Furthermore, adjusting $\mu$ does not change the state space and is thus more convenient than adjusting $N$.

%For the discrete models, note that $\theta$ corresponds to the mutation rate scaled with the effective population size. A small population size $N$ leads to more efficient iteration and for moderate $N$ changing the mutation rate is almost indistinguishable from changing the population size (and becomes identical in the diffusion limit of $N\to\infty$). Therefore, $N$ is usually set for numerical convenience and the mutation rate $\mu$ is adjusted to achieve realistic $\theta$, such that $\mu=\theta/N$. Furthermore, adjusting $\mu$ does not change the state space and is thus more convenient than adjusting $N$.

\subsection{Forward in time}

Often, our data are from the present and we want to condition on the configuration of allele frequencies at earlier times.  We introduce the row vector $\fv{t}$ with entries $(\fv{t})_{i} = \Pr(X_{t} = i)$ and set $\fv{\s} = \bs{\rho}$, \ie\ to the vector of initial probabilities of states. We can calculate the vector of probabilities of states recursively 
\begin{equation}
\fv{t+1} = \fv{t}\mathbf{T} \quad (\s \le t \le -1).
\end{equation}
This corresponds to the recursion in the forward algorithm in the theory of Hidden Markov models (HMM)~\citep[\eg][]{Vogl10}. Let $\oneC$ be a column vector of ones ($'$ depicts transposition) and $\mathbf{D}$ a diagonal matrix with the conditional likelihoods on the main diagonal, \ie\ $(\mathbf{D})_{ii}=\Pr(\y \given \x{0}=i)$. The marginal likelihood then is
\begin{equation}
\Pr(\y \given \bs{\rho}) = \fv{\s}\mathbf{T}^{|\s|}\mathbf{D}\oneC.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Backward in time}\label{section:backward}

Using a strategy as with the backward algorithm in the theory of HMM, set $\bv{0}'=\mathbf{D}\oneC$. Backward in time, the recursion is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\bv{t}' = \mathbf{T} \bv{t+1}' \quad (\s \le t \le -1),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which can also be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:backwards_discrete}
\begin{split}
\Pr(\y \given \x{t}=i) = \sum_j \Pr(\x{t+1}=j \given \x{t}=i) \Pr(\y \given \x{t+1}=j).
%&=\sum_j q_{ij} \Pr(\y \given \x{t+1}=j).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
From the definition of $\bv{t}$, it follows that we condition on $\x{t}$
\begin{equation}
(\bv{t})_{i} = \Pr(\y \given \x{t}=i).
\end{equation}
The recursion moves the conditioning to ever earlier times. The marginal likelihood may also be obtained with the backward algorithm,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:marg_lh}
\begin{split}
\Pr(\y \given \bs{\rho}) &= \fv{\s} \left[\mathbf{T}^{|\s|} \mathbf{D}\oneC\right]\\
                         &= \fv{\s} \bv{\s}' \\
                         &= \sum_i \rho_i \Pr(\y \given \x{\s}=i).
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Constancy of the marginal distribution and adjointness}

The marginal likelihood (\ref{eq:marg_lh}) is constant over time $t$ 
\begin{equation}
\Pr(\y \given \bs{\rho}) = \fv{t}\bv{t}' =\sum_i \Pr(\x{t}=i \given \bs{\rho}) \Pr(\y \given \x{t}=i) = \langle \fv{t}, \bv{t} \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle$ denotes an inner product.  It follows that forward and backward transition matrices, \ie\ $\mathbf{T}$ and its transpose $\mathbf{T}'$, are adjoint since
\begin{equation}\label{eq:adjoint_discrete}
\begin{split}
\Pr(\y \given \bs{\rho})              &= \Pr(\y \given \bs{\rho}) \\
(\fv{t}\mathbf{T})\bv{t+1}' &= \fv{t} (\mathbf{T}\bv{t+1}') \\
\langle \fv{t}\mathbf{T},\bv{t+1} \rangle   &= \langle  \fv{t},\bv{t+1}\mathbf{T}' \rangle.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Like a zipper, this adjoint relationship allows movement forward and backward in time.

\subsection{Joint and conditional distribution}

The probability of $\x{t}$ and $\y$ conditional on the starting distribution $\bs{\rho}$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:joint_xy_discr}
\Pr(\x{t}=i,\y \given \bs{\rho}) = (\fv{t})_i (\bv{t})_i\,,
\end{equation}
and the probability of $\x{t}$ conditional on the data and the starting distribution is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cond_x|y_discr}
\Pr(\x{t}=i \given \y,\bs{\rho}) = \frac{(\fv{t})_i (\bv{t})_i}{\fv{t}\bv{t}'}\,.
\end{equation}
This allows calculation of the distribution of population allele frequencies conditional on the data at any time. 

\subsection{Sampling from conditional trajectories}

It is possible to simulate trajectories given the initial distribution $\bs{\rho}$ at time $\s$ and the likelihood at time $t=0$. Note that \citet{Zhao14} provide a similar algorithm based on the Wright-Fisher model to simulate trajectories of population allelic proportions conditional on the starting and end states. In contrast, we start with a sample at time $t=\s$ from the conditional probabilities (\ref{eq:cond_x|y_discr}). Given the state at time $t-1$ the probability of the state at time $t$ is
\begin{equation}
    \Pr(\x{t}=j\given \x{t-1}=i,\y)=\frac{(\mathbf{T})_{ij}(\mathbf{b}_{t})_j}{(\mathbf{b}_{t-1})_i}\,,
\end{equation}
which can be used to obtain a sample trajectory. For $t>s$ the formula does not contain $\bs{\rho}$ since it is a Markov process.

\subsection{Left and right eigenvectors, stationary distribution}

Let $\bs{\pi} = (\pi_i)_{i \in \{0,\ldots,N\}}$ be the stationary distribution of $\mathbf{T}$, if it exists. $\bs{\pi}$ is the left eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue one~\citep[][p. 87]{Ewen04}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stationary}
\bs{\pi}=\bs{\pi}\mathbf{T}.
\end{equation}
All entries of $\bs{\pi}$ are greater than zero because the transition matrix was assumed to be irreducible and $\sum \pi_i = 1$. Thus the entries of $\bs{\pi}$ can be interpreted as probabilities. Since the rows of $\mathbf{T}$ sum to one, it is obvious that a column vector of all ones $\oneC$ is the right eigenvector associated with the unit eigenvalue. In our context, this means that iterating forward in time will converge to a vector proportional to $\bs{\pi}$ and iterating backward in time to a vector proportional to $\oneC$. Thus, every state is equally likely when  $s\to-\infty$. % CV: The backward algorithm does not conserve the total probability mass. Hence, going backward is only proportional to $\oneR$.

\subsection{Reversibility}

Define the diagonal matrix $\mathbf{\Pi}$ with the entries $\pi_i$ on the main diagonal. Since irreducible Markov chains with finite state space have stationary distributions with only strictly positive entries, $\mathbf{\Pi}$ is invertible with $\mathbf{\Pi}^{-1}$ being a diagonal matrix with entries $1/\pi_i$.  Set
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reverse_transition}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{T}^{*}=\mathbf{\Pi}\mathbf{T}\mathbf{\Pi}^{-1}\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The Markov chain is reversible, if $\mathbf{T}^{*}=\mathbf{T}'$, because then
\begin{equation}\label{eq:detailed_balance}
\begin{split}
  \mathbf{T}' &= \mathbf{T}^{*} \\
             &= \mathbf{\Pi}\mathbf{T}\mathbf{\Pi}^{-1}, \text{ or} \\
  \mathbf{T}'\mathbf{\Pi} &= \mathbf{\Pi T},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which corresponds to detailed balance.
%This condition corresponds to a balanced flow between any pair of states, \ie\ the conditions of detailed balance
% \begin{align}
% \pi_i \Pr(\x{t+1}=j \given \x{t}=i)
%                               &=  \pi_j \Pr(\x{t+1}=i \given \x{t}=j).
% \end{align}

We can separate $\fv{t}$ into a product of a time dependent row vector $\gv{t}$ and the stationary distribution matrix $\mathbf{\Pi}$
\begin{equation}\label{decomp}
\fv{t}=\gv{t}\mathbf{\Pi}.
\end{equation}
Under reversibility, we have forward in time
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\gv{t+1}\mathbf{\Pi} &=\gv{t}\mathbf{\Pi}\mathbf{T}\\
\gv{t+1}             &=\gv{t}\mathbf{\Pi}\mathbf{T}\mathbf{\Pi}^{-1}\\
\gv{t+1}             &=\gv{t}\mathbf{T}'\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Thus the ``backward'' transition matrix $\mathbf{T}'$ may be used forward and backward in time. We may interpret $\gv{t}$
% with entries:
% TODO CV and DS:
% DS: Ich glaube, das ist nicht richtig.  Wo kommt Y her?
% CV: ich glaube:
% $(\gv{t})_i=\Pr(\y_{t}\given y_{s},y_{s+1},\dots,y_{t-1},\x{t}=i)$
% DS: ist Y nicht das Sample?  Macht es Sinn Y_t zu schreiben?  Ich interpretiere g_t als ein Maß für die Entfernung vom stationären Zustand.  Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob man dieses Maß als Likelihood oder Wahrscheinlichkeit interpretieren kann. 
%CV: Red ma drueber...
as a ``projected likelihood'' that, when multiplied with the stationary distribution, gives the joint distribution $\fv{t}$. Note that with the decomposition (\ref{decomp}), the likelihood becomes
\begin{equation}
\Pr(\y \given \bs{\rho}) = \gv{t} \mathbf{\Pi} \bv{t}'.
\end{equation}
The adjoint relationship~(\ref{eq:adjoint_discrete}) can be modified analogously, to result in the self-adjoint relationship
\begin{equation}\label{eq:adjoint_discrete_2}
\begin{split}
\Pr(\y \given \bs{\rho})                              & = \Pr(\y \given \bs{\rho})                    \\
(\gv{t}\mathbf{\Pi} \mathbf{T}) \bv{t+1}'             & = \gv{t}(\mathbf{T}^{'}\mathbf{\Pi}\bv{t+1}') \\
\langle \gv{t}\mathbf{\Pi}\mathbf{T},\bv{t+1}\rangle  & = \langle \gv{t},\bv{t+1}\mathbf{\Pi}\mathbf{T} \rangle.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Example: Conditional probabilities under irreversible mutation}\label{section:irreversible}

As a particular realization of a discrete process consider a bi-allelic model, where alleles can be labeled either as ancestral (zero) or derived (one). Mutation rates are assumed to be small and limited to the boundary zero, \ie\ when only ancestral alleles are present in the population such that at most one mutation is segregating per site. When a derived allele is fixed, it immediately becomes ancestral and the process repeats. This process is a variant of the infinite sites model \citep{Kimu69} and similar to the Poisson-random-fields model \citep{Sawy92}, but differs in that it allows for a stationary distribution. Using diffusion theory, \citet{Evan07} provide an analysis based on moments of the allelic proportions of a similar model with mutations from only one boundary, assuming changing population sizes, \ie\ not assuming equilibrium. \citet{Zivk15} extend the analysis to include selection. 

The transition matrix $\mathbf{T}$ is defined as follows. Given a time-homogeneous mutation rate $\mu$, transition probabilities at the boundary zero are
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\Pr(\x{t+1}=0\given \x{t}=0)&=1-\mu/(1-\mu\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}1/i)\\
\Pr(\x{t+1}=1\given \x{t}=0)&=\mu/(1-\mu\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}1/i).
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Within the polymorphic region, random drift is the only force affecting allele frequencies, such that for $1\leq i \leq N-2$
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\Pr(\x{t+1}=i-1\given \x{t}=i) &=\frac1{N^2} i(N-i)\\
\Pr(\x{t+1}=i\given \x{t}=i)   &=1-\frac1{N^2} 2i(N-i)\\
\Pr(\x{t+1}=i+1\given \x{t}=i) &=\frac1{N^2} i(N-i)\,.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
For $i=N-1$, drift may lead to fixation of the derived allele, which then becomes the ancestral allele, \ie\
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\Pr(\x{t+1}=N-2\given \x{t}=N-1) &=\frac1{N^2} (N-1)\\
\Pr(\x{t+1}=N-1\given \x{t}=N-1) &=1-\frac1{N^2} 2(N-1)\\
\Pr(\x{t+1}=0\given \x{t}=N-1)   &=\frac1{N^2} (N-1)\,.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The state $N$ is never reached and is left out of the state space. The system is not in detailed balance, as probability mass moves from $i=N-1$ to $i=0$, but not in the reverse direction.

The stationary distribution $\bs{\pi}$ is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq_dist}
\begin{cases}
\Pr(\x{}=0)&=1-\mu\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}1/i\\
\Pr(\x{}=i)_{i \in \{1, \ldots, N-1\}} &=\mu/i\,.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

As an example of a demographic scenario (Fig.~\ref{diag}A), consider a population with a stationary allele frequency distribution \eqref{eq_dist} defined by the ancestral mutation rate $\mu_a$ at some time $s$ in the past; \ie\ $\bs{\rho} = \bs{\pi_a}$. Furthermore, assume an instantaneous expansion of the population size between generations $s$ and $s+1$. From then on, the population is out of equilibrium and evolving with a new current mutation rate $\mu_c$. At present time ($t=0$), 
we sample $M$ haplotypes from the population. Assume that the ancestral state of the sampled haplotypes can be determined without error. Thus, a polarized SFS may be constructed. For any value of $\mu_c$ and $N$, a transition matrix $\mathbf{T}$ can be calculated using the described framework. Furthermore, the matrix $\mathbf{T}^{'}$ can be used to iterate the conditioning of the allele frequency distribution backwards in time. Assume a hypergeometric distribution of $Y$, conditional on $N$, $i$, and $M$
% TODO CV: Why do we use the Hypergeometric distribution if N is scaled.  Does this make sense?
% CV: mathematical convenience rules!
% DS: I would use the binomial (with replacement), this might make more sense if the true N is large.
% CV: but then the formulas become unwieldy!
\begin{equation}\label{X0}
\Pr(\y\given N,i,M)=\frac{\binom{i}{\y}\binom{N-i}{M-\y}}{\binom{N}{M}}\,,
\end{equation}
where $0\leq \y\leq M$ and $0\leq i\leq (N-1)$. The conditional probabilities of allelic states $\Pr(\y \given \bs{\rho})$, for any time $s\leq t\leq 0$, in a site frequency spectrum of size $M$ can then be calculated (Fig.~\ref{cProb}). %For inference given a SFS, the marginal likelihood can be maximized by searching the parameter spaces of $\mu_a$, $\mu_c$, and $t$.

\subsection{Example: Joint site frequency spectrum under reversible mutation}\label{section:discr_rev_general}
As another realization of a discrete process consider a bi-allelic mutation-drift decoupled Moran model~\citep{Baak08,Ethe09} with haploid population size $N$, mutation rate towards zero $\mu_0$ and mutation rate towards one $\mu_1$ ($\mu=\mu_0+\mu_1$).  We introduce the parameters $\alpha=\mu_1/\mu$ ($0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$) and $\beta=1-\alpha=\mu_0/(\mu_0+\mu_1)$ which are the mutation biases towards one and zero, respectively.  Let $i$ ($0\leq i\leq N$) be the frequency of allele one. Then, the tri-diagonal transition rate matrix $\mathbf{T}$ depends on $N$, $\mu$ and $\alpha$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transition_decoupled_Moran}
\begin{cases}
\Pr(\x{t+1}=i-1\given \x{t}=i)&=\frac1{N^2}\left[i(N-i)+\beta\mu i\right]\\
    \Pr(\x{t+1}=i\given \x{t}=i)&=1-\frac1{N^2}\left[2i(N-i)+\beta\mu i + \alpha\mu (N-i) \right]\\
\Pr(\x{t+1}=i+1\given \x{t}=i)&=\frac1{N^2}\left[i(N-i)+\alpha\mu (N-i)\right]\,.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The stationary distribution of $\x{}$ is a beta-binomial
\begin{equation}\label{beta_bin}
\Pr(\x{}=i\given N,\alpha,\mu)=\binom{N}{i}
\frac{\Gamma(\mu)}{\Gamma(\alpha\mu)\Gamma(\beta\mu)}
\frac{\Gamma(i+\alpha\mu)\Gamma(N-i+\beta\mu)}{\Gamma(N+\mu)}\,,
\end{equation}
which can be verified by substitution into the equations of detailed balance~\eqref{eq:detailed_balance}. 
Conditional on the sample size $M$, where $M\leq N$, the sample allele frequency distribution at time $t=0$ is conveniently taken as a hypergeometric distribution conditional on $N$, $i$, and $M$ as in~\eqref{X0}.

%\subsubsection{Sample from the stationary distribution}


%Below and commented out is the proof for the above assertion:
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%\Pr(x\given N,\alpha,\mu)\Pr(x+1\given x)&=\Pr(x+1\given N,\alpha,\mu)%\Pr(x\given x+1)\\
%\binom{N}{x}
%\frac{\Gamma(\mu)}{\Gamma(\alpha\mu)\Gamma(\beta\mu)}
%\frac{\Gamma(x+\alpha\mu)\Gamma(N-x+\beta\mu)}{\Gamma(N+\mu)}(x(N-x)+\alpha\mu(N-x))&=
%\binom{N}{x+1}\frac{\Gamma(\mu)}{\Gamma(\alpha\mu)\Gamma(\beta\mu)}
%\frac{\Gamma(x+1+\alpha\mu)\Gamma((N-x-1)+\beta\mu)}{\Gamma(N+\mu)}((x+1)(N-x-1)+\beta\mu(x+1))\\
%\Gamma(x+\alpha\mu)\Gamma(N-x+\beta\mu)(x+\alpha\mu)&=\Gamma(x+1+\alpha\mu)(\Gamma(N-x-1+\beta\mu)(N-x-1+\beta\mu)\,.
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%Assuming equilibrium, the marginal likelihood of a single sample of size $M$ is again a beta-binomial.
%Below and commented out is the proof for the above assertion:
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:betabin_allover}
%\begin{split}
%\Pr(y\given M,\alpha,\mu)&=\sum_{i=0}^{N}\Pr(y\given N,x,M)\Pr(x\given N,\alpha,\mu)\\
%&=\sum_{i=y}^{y+(N-M)}\frac{\binom{x}{y}\binom{N-x)}{M-y}}{\binom{N}{M}}\binom{N}{x}\\
%&\qquad\frac{\Gamma(\mu)}{\Gamma(\alpha\mu)\Gamma(\beta\mu)}
%\frac{\Gamma(x+\alpha\mu)\Gamma(N-x)+\beta\mu)}{\Gamma(N+\mu)}\\
%&=\binom{M}{y}\frac{\Gamma(\mu)}{\Gamma(\alpha\mu)\Gamma(\beta\mu)}
%\frac{\Gamma(y+\alpha\mu)\Gamma(M-y+\beta\mu)}{\Gamma(M+\mu)}\,.
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%The previous identity (\ref{eq:betabin_allover}) follows from recursively applying the next identity. Given a sample of size $K$ from the beta-binomial, the probability of observing $y$ in a sub-sample of size $K-1$ without replacement has the probability 
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%&\Pr(y\given K-1,\alpha,\mu)=
%\frac{K-y+1}{K+1}\Pr(y\given K,\alpha,\mu)+\frac{y+1}{K+1}\Pr(y+1\given K,\alpha,\mu)\\
%&=\frac{\Gamma(\mu)}{\Gamma(\alpha\mu)\Gamma(\beta\mu)}\left(
%\frac{K-y+1}{K+1} \frac{(K+1)!}{y!(K-y+1)!}\frac{\Gamma(y+\alpha\mu)\Gamma(K+1-y+\beta\mu)}{\Gamma(K+1+\mu)}\right.\\
%&\qquad\left.+\frac{y+1}{K+1} \frac{(K+1)!}{(y+1)!(K-y)!}\frac{\Gamma(y+1+\alpha\mu)\Gamma(K-y+\beta\mu)}{\Gamma(K+1+\mu)}\right)
%\\
%&=\binom{K}{y}\frac{\Gamma(\mu)}{\Gamma(\alpha\mu)\Gamma(\beta\mu)}\frac{\Gamma(y+\alpha\mu)\Gamma(K-y+\beta\mu)}{\Gamma(K+\mu)}\left(
%\frac{K-y+\beta\mu}{K+\mu}
%+\frac{y+\alpha\mu}{K+\mu}\right)
%\\
%&=\binom{K}{y}\frac{\Gamma(\mu)}{\Gamma(\alpha\mu)\Gamma(\beta\mu)}
%\frac{\Gamma(y+\alpha\mu)\Gamma(K-y+\beta\mu)}{\Gamma(K+\mu)}\,.
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}

Consider an ancestral population with stationary allele frequency distribution~\eqref{beta_bin}. The ancestral population splits into two at some time $s$ in the past (Fig.~\ref{diag}B). Assume, for simplicity, that equilibrium is maintained in both populations. A jSFS is simulated from both populations (Table~\ref{jointSFSdiscr}) at the present time $t=0$. The likelihood of the split time $t$ can be calculated given the jSFS (Figure~\ref{twoPopdiscr}A).

\section{Derivation of the forward and backward diffusion equations from the decoupled mutation-drift Moran model}\label{diffDer}

In this section, we derive the forward and backward diffusion equation from the forward and backward transition probabilities of the decoupled Moran model and show the tight connections between the discrete and continuous models. Derivations are simpler than usual \citep{Ewen04}; terms higher than the first derivative with respect to time and second derivative with respect to space do not occur. 

Consider a focal bi-allelic site with the population frequency of allele zero denoted by $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq N-1$). With the transition probabilities of the decoupled Moran model (\ref{eq:transition_decoupled_Moran}), the frequency $i$ may increase or decrease by one due to mutation or drift or remain constant. Forward in time, the difference of the probability at frequency $i$ per Moran step may be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forw_discr_mutation}
\begin{split}
&\Pr(\x{t+1}=i)-\Pr(\x{t}=i) = \\
&\qquad \frac{\alpha\theta}{N^2} \bigg[(N-i+1)\Pr(\x{t}=i-1) - (N-i)\Pr(\x{t}=i)\bigg]\\
&\qquad+\frac{\beta\theta}{N^2} \bigg[(i+1)\Pr(\x{t}=i+1) - i\Pr(\x{t}=i)\bigg]\\
&\qquad+\frac1{N^2}\bigg[(i-1)(N-i+1)\Pr(\x{t}=i-1) \\
&\qquad+ (i+1)(N-i-1)\Pr(\x{t}=i+1)-2i(N-1)\Pr(\x{t}=i)\bigg]\,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the first square brackets corresponds to mutation towards allele one, the second to mutation towards allele zero, and the third to genetic drift.

To approximate the change in frequency as a continuous time and space process, the discrete time $t$ is usually replaced by $\tau = t/N^2$ and the discrete allele frequency $i$ by the proportion $x=i/N$. The average lifespan of an individual or the generation time in the Wright-Fisher model corresponds to $N$ Moran time steps, such that, after rescaling, time is measured in units of $N$ Wright-Fisher generations. We introduce the quantities $\delta \tau=1/N^2$ and $\delta x=1/N$ and rewrite (\ref{eq:forw_discr_mutation})
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forw_cont_mutation}
\begin{split}
&\frac{\Pr(\x{\tau+\delta \tau}=x)-\Pr(\x{\tau}=x)}{\delta \tau} =\\ &\qquad\alpha\theta \bigg[\frac{(1-x+\delta x)\Pr(\x{\tau}=x-\delta x) - (1-x)\Pr(\x{\tau}=x)}{\delta x}\bigg]\\
&\qquad+\beta\theta \bigg[\frac{(x+\delta x)\Pr(\x{\tau}=x+\delta x) - x\Pr(\x{\tau}=x)}{\delta x}\bigg]\\
&\qquad+\bigg[\frac{(x-\delta x)(1-x+\delta x)\Pr(\x{\tau}=x-\delta x)}{\delta x^2}\\
&\qquad+ \frac{(x+\delta x)(1-x-\delta x)\Pr(\x{\tau}=x+\delta x)}{\delta x^2}-\frac{2x(1-x)\Pr(\x{\tau}=x)}{\delta x^2}\bigg].\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

In the limit $N \to \infty$, the term to the left of the equality sign of (\ref{eq:forw_cont_mutation}) corresponds to the definition of the first derivative with respect to time $\tau$ of $\Pr(\x{\tau}=x)$; the first two terms in square brackets after the equality sign correspond to the first derivatives with respect to $x$ of $-(1-x)\Pr(\x{\tau}=x)$ and $x\Pr(\x{\tau}=x)$, respectively; the term in the last square bracket corresponds to the definition of the second symmetric derivative with respect to $x$ of $x(1-x)\Pr(\x{\tau}=x)$.  After minor rearrangements and setting $\phi(x,\tau)$ to the probability density at frequency $x$ and time $\tau$, the familiar form of the forward mutation-drift diffusion equation is obtained:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forw_mutdrift}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \phi(x,\tau) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\theta(\alpha-x)\phi(x,\tau) +\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}x(1-x)\phi(x,\tau).
\end{equation}

Considering the Moran model backward in time (see Subsection~\ref{section:backward}), the change in frequency $i$ is determined by the transpose of the forward transition matrix (\ref{eq:transition_decoupled_Moran}) and can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:back_discr_mutation}
\begin{split}
&\Pr(\x{0} \given\x{t}=i)-\Pr(\x{0}\given\x{t+1}=i) = \\
&\qquad \frac{\alpha \theta (N-i)}{N^2} \bigg[\Pr(\x{0}\given\x{t+1}=i+1)-\Pr(\x{0}\given\x{t+1}=i)\bigg]\\
&\qquad+ \frac{\beta \theta i}{N^2} \bigg[\Pr(\x{0}\given\x{t+1}=i-1)-\Pr(\x{0}\given\x{t+1}=i)\bigg]\\
&\qquad+ \frac{i(N-i)}{N^2} \bigg[\Pr(\x{0}\given\x{t+1}=i+1)+\Pr(\x{0}\given\x{t+1}=i-1)\\
&\qquad-2\Pr(\x{0}\given\x{t+1}=i)\bigg]\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

After rescaling time and space, considering the limit $N \to \infty$ and defining $\psi(x,\tau)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\Pr(\x{0}\given\x{\tau}=x)$ we get the backward diffusion equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:backw_mutdrift}
-\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \psi(x,\tau) =
    \theta(\alpha-x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \psi(x,\tau) +x(1-x)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\psi(x,\tau).
\end{equation}
The minus sign on the left side of the backward diffusion equation (\ref{eq:backw_mutdrift}) may be unusual, but necessary such that the time $\tau$ runs in the same direction in the forward and backward diffusion. Note that \citet{Zhao13a} also use a pair of forward and backward diffusion equations with differing signs.

%It is straightforward to modify the assumptions in Section~\ref{section:assumptions} to continuous time.

\section{Forward and backward diffusion equations}\label{forwBackDiff}

In this section, we provide theory of the continuous analogs for the discrete forward and backward transition probabilities both for reversible and irreversible Markov processes. Furthermore, we illustrate with examples.

Note that the forward diffusion equation can also be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forw_general}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\phi(x,\tau)&=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x} P(x)\phi(x,\tau)+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} Q(x) \phi(x,\tau) = {\cal L} \phi(x, \tau)\,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and the corresponding backward diffusion equation as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:backw_general}
\begin{split}
-\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\psi(x,\tau)&=P(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \psi(x,\tau)+Q(x)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \psi(x,\tau) = {\cal L}^{*} \psi(x, \tau)\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The operators ${\cal L}$ and ${\cal L}^{*}$ correspond to the forward transition matrix $\mathbf{T}$ and its transpose $\mathbf{T}^{'}$, respectively.

\subsection{Forward and backward in time}

% TODO JB: Maybe state that y now goes from 0 to 1 and not from 0 to N (like x).
% CV: y goes from 0 to M
As in the discrete case, consider the situation when the distribution of $x$ is given at time $\tau=\s$ by $\rho(x)$. The likelihood of the data $y$, conditional on $x$ at time $\tau=0$ is $p(y\given x,\tau=0)$. The marginal likelihood of $y$ may be obtained by setting $\phi(x,\tau=\s)=\rho(x)$ and calculating $\phi(x,\tau=0)$ using the forward diffusion equation~(\ref{eq:forw_general}). In the backward time direction, set the initial distribution of the backward diffusion equation  $\psi(x,\tau=0)=p(y\given x,\tau=0)$. With the backward diffusion equation~(\ref{eq:backw_general}), the conditioning on $x$ may be moved backward in time. The marginal likelihood, \ie\ the integral over the product of the forward and backward functions with respect to the allelic proportion $x$, is constant for all times $\tau$ 
% TODO CV or JB: This does not match the formula above (is it the same? or does Dom miss something?  Where did the "sampling step" go?
%CV: did the insertion of , "with..." above fix this problem?
\begin{equation}\label{eq:marg_like}
p(y) = \int_{0}^{1} \phi(x,\tau)\psi(x,\tau)  \,dx\,.
\end{equation}

% Introduce the forward and backward diffusion operators 
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{split}
%     {\cal L}&=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}P(x)+ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}Q(x)\\
%     {\cal L}^{*}&=P(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x} +Q(x)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\,.
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% These operators correspond to the forward transition matrix $\mathbf{T}$ and it's transpose $\mathbf{T}^{'}$. Then the forward and backward diffusion equations~(\ref{eq:forw_general}) and (\ref{eq:backw_general}) may be written as
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{split}
%     \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\phi(x,\tau)&={\cal L}\,\phi(x,\tau)\\
%     -\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\psi(x,\tau)&={\cal L}^{*}\psi(x,\tau)\,.
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
The forward and backward operators are adjoint \citep[\eg][]{Durr08}. Since $p(y)$ is constant, its derivative with respect to the time $\tau$ is $0$. Applying the product rule, we thus have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:adjoint_continuous}
\begin{split}
\frac{d}{d\tau}\int_{0}^{1} \phi(x,\tau) \psi(x,\tau)dx &= 0\\
\int_{0}^{1} \left[\frac{d}{d\tau} \phi(x,\tau)\right] \psi(x,\tau)dx &= -\int_{0}^{1} \phi(x,\tau) \left[\frac{d}{d\tau} \psi(x,\tau)\right] dx\\
\int_{0}^{1} \left[{\cal L}\,\phi(x,\tau)\right] \psi(x,\tau)dx &= \int_{0}^{1}  \phi(x,\tau) \left[{\cal L}^{*} \psi(x,\tau)\right] dx\\
\langle{\cal L}\,\phi(x,\tau), \psi(x,\tau)\rangle &= \langle \phi(x,\tau),{\cal L}^{*} \psi(x,\tau)\rangle.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
At each time point, any change to the marginal likelihood from applying the forward operator ${\cal L}$ to the forward function $\phi(x,\tau)$ is exactly matched by a change from applying the backward operator ${\cal L}^{*}$ to the backward function $\psi(x,\tau)$. 

These relationships follow from those in the discrete case. As in the discrete case, the adjoint relationship allows movement forward and backward in time. 

\subsection{Joint and conditional distributions}

The joint distribution of the allelic proportion $x$ and the sample allele frequency $y$ at time $\tau$ ($s \le \tau \le 0$) is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:joint_x_y}
p(x,y \given \tau)= \phi(x, \tau)\psi(x,\tau)\,.
\end{equation}
For the conditional distribution of the allelic proportion $x$ given the sample allele frequency $y$, the joint distribution (\ref{eq:joint_x_y}) must be divided by the marginal likelihood (\ref{eq:marg_like})
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cond_x|y}
p(x\given \tau)= \frac{\phi(x, \tau)\psi(x,\tau)}{p(y)}\,.
\end{equation}
These two distributions correspond to the distributions (\ref{eq:joint_xy_discr}) and (\ref{eq:cond_x|y_discr}) in the discrete case, respectively. 

\subsection{Reversibility}

Assume that $\pi(x)$ is the stationary distribution of the forward equation (\ref{eq:forw_general}), such that 
\begin{equation}
P(x)\pi(x)=\frac{d}{d x}Q(x)\pi(x).
\end{equation}
Note that $\pi(x)$ corresponds to the speed density \citep{Ewen04,Song12}. 

If the continuous Markov process is reversible, the backward equation (\ref{eq:backw_general}) can be obtained by multiplication with the stationary distribution, as in the discrete case. Substituting $\phi(x,\tau)=\pi(x)\psi(x,\tau)$ into the general forward equation (\ref{eq:forw_general}), we obtain the general backward equation
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\pi(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \psi(x,\tau)&=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}P(x)\pi(x)\psi(x,\tau)+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}Q(x)\pi(x) \psi(x,\tau)\\
%\pi(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\psi(x,\tau)&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[-P(x)\pi(x)\psi(x,\tau)+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}Q(x)\pi(x)\psi(x,\tau)\right]\\
%\pi(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\psi(x,\tau)&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[-P(x)\pi(x)\psi(x,\tau)+P(x)\pi(x)\psi(x,\tau)+Q(x)\pi(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\psi(x,\tau)\right]\\
%\pi(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\psi(x,\tau)&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[Q(x)\pi(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\psi(x,\tau)\right]\\
\pi(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\psi(x,t)&=P(x)\pi(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\psi(x,\tau) +Q(x)\pi(x)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\psi(x,\tau)\\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\psi(x,\tau)&=P(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\psi(x,\tau)+Q(x)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\psi(x,\tau)\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

With reversibility, we may thus write the relationship between the forward operator ${\cal L}$ and its adjoint ${\cal L}^{*}$ compactly
\begin{equation}\label{compact}
{\cal L}^{*}=\frac1{\pi(x)}\left[{\cal L}\pi(x)\right],
\end{equation}
similar to the reversed transition matrix (\ref{eq:reverse_transition}) in the discrete case. With reversibility, it is possible to conventionally use the ``backward'' operator ${\cal L}^{*}$ backward in time to push conditioning on $x$ back or, unconventionally, forward in time with a decomposition of the forward function  $\phi(x,\tau)$ into a product of the stationary distribution $\pi(x)$ and $g(x,\tau)$, as in the discrete case.

With reversibility, the adjoint relationship (\ref{eq:adjoint_continuous}) becomes the self-adjoint relationship, with respect to the stationary distribution $\pi(x)$ \citep{Song12}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:selfadjoint}
\begin{split}
\int_0^1 \pi(x) \left[{\cal L}^{*} g(x,\tau)\right]\psi(x,\tau)\,dx&=
\int_0^1  \pi(x)g(x,\tau)\left[{\cal L}^{*} \psi(x,\tau)\right]\,dx\\
\langle {\cal L}^{*} g(x,\tau),\psi(x,\tau) \rangle_{\pi}&=\langle g(x,\tau),{\cal L}^{*} \psi(x,\tau) \rangle_{\pi}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Example: reversible boundary mutation model with binomial likelihood}

Assuming the boundary mutation model \citep{Vogl15,Vogl16}, the forward diffusion equation with the equilibrium solution and an approach with orthogonal polynomials can be found in \citet{Vogl14b} and \citet{Vogl16} and is reviewed briefly in here; the backward analysis is new.

With the  boundary mutation model, the scaled mutation rate $\theta=(\mu_0+\mu_1)N$ is assumed to be much less than one, such that away from the immediate vicinity of the boundaries, the forces of drift are much stronger than mutational forces. Only very close to the boundaries, in regions $0\leq x \leq\alpha\theta$ and $(1-\beta\theta) \leq x \leq 1$, mutation can overcome drift (see Fig.~1 in \citet{Vogl15}). This suggests replacing the linear mutation terms in the forward diffusion equation (\ref{eq:forw_general}) with a step function.

\subsubsection{Forward in time}

Forward in time, the mutation term in the diffusion equation is thus replaced by either a Heaviside function, before differentiation with respect to space, or a delta function, after differentiation with respect to space. The latter variant leads to:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forw_bounddrift}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \phi(x,\tau)&=
    \lim_{N\to\infty}\alpha\theta N\delta(x-\tfrac1N) \,b_0(\tau)
    +\lim_{N\to\infty}\beta\theta N\delta(x-\tfrac{N-1}N) \,b_1(\tau)\\
    &\qquad+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}x(1-x)\,\phi(x,\tau)\,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $b_0(\tau)$ and $b_1(\tau)$ are the values at the boundaries zero and one at time $\tau$, respectively, if all the interior probability mass drifted to their expected locations of fixation. At the boundaries, dynamics are slow compared to the region inside, since only a short time is spent in the polymorphic region compared to the time waiting for the mutations to leave the boundary region. 

The following function solves the forward equation under assumption of stationarity
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \pi(x, \alpha, \theta)&=\left(b_0(\tau=\infty)-\alpha\beta\theta \lim_{N\to\infty}\int_{\tfrac1N}^{\tfrac{N-1}N} \frac1x\,dx\right)\delta(x)+\alpha\beta\theta\frac{1}{x(1-x)} \\
    &\qquad+\left(b_1(\tau=\infty)-\lim_{N\to\infty}\alpha\beta\theta \int_{\tfrac1N}^{\tfrac{N-1}N} \frac1{1-x}\,dx\right)\delta(x-1)\,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with the boundary probabilities $b_0(\tau=\infty)=\beta$ and $b_1(\tau=\infty)=\alpha$ \citep{Vogl15,Vogl16}. This function integrates to unity, but may attain negative values at the boundaries and thus must be considered a generalized measure. 

The forward diffusion equation (\ref{eq:forw_bounddrift}) can be solved by starting from the eigensystem of the general forward equation, \ie\ the product of the modified Jacobi polynomials \citep{Song12} and the equilibrium beta distribution, and letting the scaled mutation rate $\theta$ approach zero \citep[][Appendix A.1]{Vogl15}. Close to the boundaries, terms then converge to point masses, which can be represented by Dirac delta distributions. Note that the resulting functions are not strictly eigenfunctions, since they are coupled at the boundaries, such that we refer to them as \textit{augmented eigenfunctions} in the following. 

The forward eigenfunctions can be ordered according to their eigenvalues. For $n=0$, the eigenvalue is $\lambda_0=0$ and the augmented eigenfunction $\beta\delta(x)+\alpha\delta(x-1)$; for $n=1$, the eigenvalue is $\lambda_n=\theta$ and the augmented eigenfunction $-\delta(x)+\delta(x-1)$. The boundary terms $b_0(\tau)$ and $b_1(\tau)$ can be represented with these two eigenfunctions. For $n\geq 2$, the eigenvalues are $\lambda_n=n(n-1)$, such that they change much faster and the augmented eigenfunctions are \begin{equation}\label{eq:forw_eigen}
    H_n(x)=\tfrac{(-1)^n}{n}\delta(x)+U_n(x)+\tfrac{1}{n}\delta(x-1)\,,
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
    U_n(x)=\frac1{x(1-x)}G_n(x)=-\frac2{n+2}C_n(2x-1)^{(3/2)}\,,
\end{equation}
where the $G_n(x)$ are defined as in \citet{Song12} and the $C_n(z)^{(\alpha)}$ are the classical Gegenbauer polynomials \citep{Abra70}.

For a sample of size $M$, a binomial likelihood of the data $y$ is conveniently assumed
\begin{equation}
\Pr(y\given M, x) = \binom{M}{y} x^y (1-x)^{M-y}.
\end{equation}
Forward in time, the starting condition is then either the joint distribution of $x$ and $y$, after multiplication of the binomial likelihood with the equilibrium distribution $\Pr(y\given M, x)\pi(x, \alpha,\theta)$, or the conditional distribution of the population allelic proportion $x$ given the data $y$, \ie\ the joint distribution divided by the marginal likelihood. For $1\leq y\leq (M-1)$, the initial distribution corresponds to a polynomial of order $M-2$. For monomorphic data and $1/N\leq x \leq (N-1)/N$, the initial distribution is then proportional to
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\frac{(1-x)^{M-1}}{x}&\text{for $y=0$,}\\
\frac{x^{M-1}}{1-x} &\text{for $y=M$.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
These rational functions can be expanded into infinite series of polynomials, and are well-approximated by the expansion in the augmented eigenfunctions after a finite number of terms \citep{Vogl16}.

\subsubsection{Backward in time}

Because the system is assumed to be time-reversible, the backward diffusion equation can be obtained from the forward diffusion equation as in \eqref{compact}. The relationship between the boundaries forward and backward in time then are
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\beta b_0^{*}(\tau)&= b_0(\tau), \,\text{and}\\ 
\alpha b_1^{*}(\tau)&=b_1(\tau).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Substituting these boundary terms and  $\tfrac{\alpha\beta\theta}{x(1-x)}\psi(x,\tau)$ for $\phi(x,\tau)$ into the forward boundary-mutation diffusion equation (\ref{eq:forw_bounddrift}) results in the backward boundary-mutation diffusion equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:back_bounddrift}
\begin{split}
\frac{\alpha\beta\theta}{x(1-x)}\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \psi(x,\tau)&=
     \lim_{N\to\infty}\bigg[{\alpha\beta\theta}N\delta(x-\tfrac1N)\,b_0^{*}(\tau)  
    +{\alpha\beta\theta}N\delta(x-\tfrac{N-1}N) \,b_1^{*}(\tau)\bigg]\\
    &\qquad+{\alpha\beta\theta}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\,\psi(x,\tau)\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \psi(x,\tau)&=x(1-x)
     \lim_{N\to\infty}\bigg[N\left(\delta(x-\tfrac1N)\,b_0^{*}(\tau) +\delta(x-\tfrac{N-1}N) \,b_1^{*}(\tau)\right)\bigg]\\
    &\qquad+x(1-x)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\,\psi(x,\tau)\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Since the Markov process is reversible, the left hand side of the equation could also be multiplied with $-1$ and the time reversed to fit the direction in eq.~(\ref{eq:backw_general}). Note that this equation does not contain the mutation terms $\alpha$ and $\theta$, however $b_0^{*}(\tau)$ and $b_1^{*}(\tau)$ are functions of the mutation terms. 

The backward augmented eigenfunctions have the same eigenvalues as the corresponding forward augmented eigenfunctions. The eigenvectors $H_n^{*}$ can be obtained by division of the forward eigenfunctions (\ref{eq:forw_eigen}) with the equilibrium distribution. 
For convenience, we also multiply with the constant ${\alpha\beta\theta}$. For $n\geq 2$, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:backw_eigen}
\begin{split}
    H_n^{*}(x)&= \frac{\alpha\beta\theta}{\pi(x, \alpha, \theta)} H_n(x)\\
    &=\alpha\theta\tfrac{(-1)^n}{ n}\delta(x)+x(1-x)U_n(x)+\beta\theta\tfrac{1}{n}\delta(x-1)\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%This also implies that the augmented eigenfunctions with $n=0$ and $n=1$, and thus $b_0^{*}(\tau)$ and $b_1^{*}(\tau)$, are multiplied with the same proportionality constant, because of coupling via the boundary terms. 

\todo[inline]{The next part is for internal use to clarify with which terms to augment to backward eigenfunction}
Consider the joint probability of $x$ and $y$ given the stationary distribution as prior and a binomial likelihood with sample size $M$ and $y$ alleles of the first allelic type. Then the joint distribution is 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
     &\Pr(x,y\given M, \dots)=\\
    &\begin{cases}
    \beta-\vartheta\int_{1/N}^{(N-1)/N} \frac{1}{x} dx - \vartheta x^{-1}(1-x)^{M-1} &\text{for $y=0$,}\\
    \vartheta \binom{M}{y}x^{y-1}(1-x)^{M-y-1} &\text{for $1\leq y\leq (M-1)$,}\\
    \alpha-\vartheta\int_{1/N}^{(N-1)/N} \frac{1}{1-x} dx - \vartheta x^{M-1}(1-x)^{-1} &\text{for $y=M$,}
    \end{cases}
   \end{split}
\end{equation}
and the marginal distribution of $y$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:marginal_y}
    \Pr(y\given M, \dots)=
    \begin{cases}
    \beta-\vartheta\sum_{i=1}^{M-1} \frac{1}{i} &\text{for $y=0$,}\\
    \vartheta \frac{M}{y(M-y)} &\text{for $1\leq y\leq (M-1)$,}\\
    \alpha-\vartheta\sum_{i=1}^{M-1} \frac{1}{i} &\text{for $y=M$.}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The latter makes more sense than the former, because it is a probability distribution as long as $2\vartheta\sum_{i=1}^{M-1} \frac{1}{i}\leq 1$.

The same marginal distribution must be obtained by expanding into the eigenfunctions and integrating. Note that the expansion of the stationary distribution is
\begin{equation}
\Pr(x\given \dots)=\beta\delta(x)+\alpha\delta(x-1)+\vartheta\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{4(2i-2)}{2i-1} H_{2i}\,.
\end{equation}
Note that the integral in the stationary distribution is replaced by the infinite sum of the boundary terms of the augmented eigenfunctions $H_i(x)$. 

For polymorphic $y$, we have
\begin{equation}
    \Pr(y\given M,\dots)=\frac{M}{y}x^{y}(1-x)^y=b_0+\sum_{i=2} a_i(y) H_i^{*}(x)\,.
\end{equation}
All boundary terms must be zero, since the likelihood has zero support at the boundaries.
Consider now the marginal distribution of $y$. It is obvious from the orthogonality relation 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \int_0^1 \Pr(y\given M, x, t=0,\dots)\Pr(x)\,dx&=\Pr(y\given M)\\
    &=\vartheta\int_0^1 U_i(x)U_j(x)x(1-x)\,dx=\vartheta\Delta_i \delta_{ij}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_i = \frac{i-1}{(2i-1)i}
\end{equation}
that only terms up to order $i=M$ are needed in the expansion. Considering that the stationary distribution only has even terms, odd terms can be neglected. We thus have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \vartheta\frac{M}{y(M-y)}&=\vartheta\sum_{i=1}^{[M/2]}a_{2i}(y)\frac{4(2i)-2}{2i-1}\int_0^1U_{2i}(x)U_{2i}(x) x(1-x)\,dx\\
    \frac{M}{y(M-y)}&=\sum_{i=1}^{[M/2]}a_{2i}(y)\frac{8i-2)}{2i-1}\Delta_{2i}\\
    &=\sum_{i=1}^{[M/2]}a_{2i}(y)\frac{2(4i-1)}{2i-1}\frac{2i-1}{(4i-1)2i}\\
    &=\sum_{i=1}^{[M/2]}a_{2i}(y)\frac{1}{i}\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Note that this relationship needs to hold for all times $t<0$, \ie\ 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inner_product}
    \int_0^1 \Pr(y\given M, x, t,\dots)\Pr(x)\,dx=\Pr(y\given M)\,.
\end{equation} 
This is accomplished with the starting values $\tau_i(t=0,y)=a_{2i}(y)$ backwards in time. For $t\to -\infty$, the likelihood becomes flat and the $\tau_i(t=\infty,y)$ converge to the equilibrium values proportional to $\frac{4(2i-2)}{2i-1}$. Thus the proportionality constant must be $\Pr(y\given M,\dots)=\vartheta \frac{M}{y(M-y)}$. Furthermore, the boundaries also need to converge to the same flat likelihood, \ie\ $b_0^{*}(t=\infty)=b_1^{*}(t=\infty)=\vartheta \frac{M}{y(M-y)}$. 

We have, forward in time with $\mathbf{b}(t)=(b_1(t),b_0(t))$ a system of differential equations 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forw_de_b}
    \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{b}(t)=\mathbf{b}(t)\mathbf{T}
\end{equation}
with the transition rate matrix 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forward_T_bound}
    \mathbf{T}=\theta
    \begin{pmatrix}
    -\alpha &\alpha\\
    \beta &-\beta\\
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
Backward in time, we have $\mathbf{b}^{*}(t)=(b_1^{*}(t),b_0^{*}(t))^{'}$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forw_de_b}
    \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{b}^{*}(t)=\mathbf{T}\mathbf{b}^{*}(t)
\end{equation}
We have 
\begin{equation}
    b_0(t=0,y)=\binom{M}{y}x^{y-1}(1-x)^{M-y}
    =\vartheta\binom{M}{y}\frac{\Gamma(M-y+1)\Gamma(y)}{\Gamma(M+1)}=\vartheta\frac1{y}
\end{equation}
and $b_1(t=0)=\vartheta\frac1{M-y}$.
We thus have 
\begin{equation}
    b_0(t,y)=\vartheta\bigg(\bigg(\beta\frac{M}{y(M-y)}-\frac1{y}\bigg)e^{\theta t}-\frac1{y}\bigg)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    b_0^{*}(t,y)=\vartheta\bigg(\frac{M}{y(M-y)}-\frac{1}{\beta}\frac1{y}\bigg)e^{\theta t}-\frac{1}{\beta}\frac1{y}\bigg)\,.
\end{equation}
The other boundary follows similarly. 

Thus the sum of the boundary terms of the augmented eigenfunctions must be initially for the forward functions
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
    \sum_{i=2}^M a_i(y)\frac{(-1)^i}{i}&=\vartheta\frac1{y}\\
    \sum_{i=2}^M a_i(y)\frac{1^i}{i}&=\vartheta\frac1{M-y}\,.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Substituting the expansion into the inner product, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inner_product}
\begin{split}
    \Pr(y\given M)&=\int_0^1 \Pr(y\given M, x, t,\dots)\Pr(x)\,dx\\
    &\int_0^1 \bigg(b_0^{*}(t)\delta(x)+b_1^{*}(t)\delta(x-1)+\sum_{i=2}^{\infty}\tau_i(t,y) H_i^{*}\bigg)\Pr(x)\,dx \\
    &\int_0^1 \bigg(b_0^{*}(t)\delta(x)+b_1^{*}(t)\delta(x-1)+\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\tau_i(t,y) H_{2i}^{*}(x)\bigg)\\
    &\qquad\times \bigg(\beta\delta(x)+\alpha\delta(x-1)+\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{4(2i-2)}{2i-1} H_i(x)\bigg)\,dx \\
    &=\int_0^1 \bigg(b_0(t)\delta(x)+b_1(t)\delta(x-1)\bigg)\\
    &\qquad +\bigg(\beta\delta(x)+\alpha\delta(x-1)\bigg)\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\tau_i(t,y) H_{2i}^{*}(x)\bigg)\\
    &\qquad +\bigg(b_0^{*}(t)\delta(x)+b_1^{*}(t)\bigg)\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{4(2i-2)}{2i-1} H_i(x)\bigg)\\
    &\qquad+ \bigg(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\tau_i(t,y) H_i^{*}\bigg)\bigg(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{4(2i-2)}{2i-1} H_i(x)\bigg)\,dx \\
    \,.
\end{split}
\end{equation} 
This is a great big mess at the boundaries!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

\todo[inline]{End of part for internal use.}


%CV: the collision of the $\tau$'s is ugly.
From eq.~(\ref{eq:back_bounddrift}) and the relationship of the forward and backward eigenfunctions in eq.~(\ref{eq:backw_eigen}), it follows that the time-dependent part of both the forward and the backward system is solved by the same system of inhomogeneous linear differential equations, \ie\ eqs.~(40)-(51) in \citet{Vogl16}. 

\subsection{Example: irreversible boundary mutation model %with binomial likelihood
}\label{section:irreversible_diffusion}

Similar considerations to above also apply to the model in section~(\ref{section:irreversible}) with irreversible mutation, \ie\ where the ancestral and derived states are contrasted. Note that \citet{Evan07} arrive at the same irreversible diffusion model from a Wright-Fisher model and provide recursive equations of moments instead of orthogonal polynomials to calculate the expected SFS under non-equilibrium conditions. \citet{Zivk11} extend their analysis to provide the solution backward in time.  If $N\to\infty$, $\theta/(1-\theta\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}1/i)$ goes to infinity, such that the model collapses. Hence, we assume that mutations constantly supply probability mass from the boundaries to $x=1/N$ at rate $N\theta$ (after scaling time). The forward diffusion equation then becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forw_onebounddrift}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \phi(x,\tau)&=
    \lim_{N\to\infty} N\theta \delta(x-\tfrac1N)b+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}x(1-x)\,\phi(x,\tau)\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The term $b$ corresponds to the probability $\int_0^1\phi(x,\tau=0)\,dx$, which is unity if the initial distribution integrates to one. The equilibrium distribution is 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \pi(x\given\theta)&=\left(1-\lim_{N\to\infty}\theta \int_{\tfrac1N}^{\tfrac{N-1}N} \frac1x\,dx\right)\delta(x)+\theta\frac{1}{x(1-x)}\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The augmented eigenfunctions are for $n\geq 2$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forw_onebound_eigen}
    H_n(x)=\tfrac{(-1)^n+1}{n}\delta(x)+U_n(x)\,,
\end{equation}
while the zeroth and first eigenfunctions collapse to $\delta(x)$. %Substituting $\sum_nT_n(\tau) H_n(x)$ into the forward differential equation (\ref{eq:forw_onebounddrift}) results in the inhomogeneous linear differential equation describing the time-dependent part of the solution
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:inhomogeneous}
%    \frac{d}{d\tau}T_n(\tau)=-\lambda T_n(\tau)-\theta (2n-1)n(-1)^n\,.
%\end{equation}


%Consider a sample of size $M=2$, where $y \in (0,1,2)$ and assume stationarity. The likelihoods are $\Pr(y\given M=2)=\binom{2}{y}x^{y}(1-x)^{M-y}$ such that the joint probabilities under stationarity are for $y=1$: $\Pr(x,y=1\given M=2)=\theta 2(1-x)$ and for $y=2$: $\Pr(x,y=1\given M=2)=\theta x$. They can easily be expanded into polynomials $H_n(x)$ up to order $n=3$. For both, the boundary term at $\tau=0$ must be zero, such that $b=\theta$ and $b=\theta/2$, for $y=1$ and $y=2$, respectively. For $y=0$, we have inside the polymorphic region the expansion $\theta (1-x)^2/x=\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{n+2}$ and at the boundary $b=1-3\theta/2$. Substituting these initial values into the inhomogeneous differential equations (\ref{eq:inhomogeneous}) results in the expansion for all $\tau>0$.

Due to the irreversibility of the model, the corresponding backward diffusion equation needs to be derived directly from the transition matrix, instead of substituting the equilibrium distribution into the forward equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:backw_onebounddrift}
\begin{split}
-\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \psi(x,\tau)&=
    x(1-x)\lim_{N\to\infty}\bigg[N\left(\delta(x-\tfrac1N)+\delta(x-\tfrac{N-1}N)\right)b^{*}\bigg]\\
    &\qquad+x(1-x)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\,\psi(x,\tau)\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We note that there are two boundary terms in (\ref{eq:backw_onebounddrift}), instead of just one as in the forward case (\ref{eq:forw_onebounddrift}). 
The augmented backward eigenfunctions are then
\begin{equation}\label{eq:backw_oneboundeigen}
\begin{split}
    H_n^{*}(x)&=\theta\tfrac{(-1)^n+1}{ n}\delta(x)+x(1-x)U_n(x)\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

As in the previous example, the product of the time-dependent part of the solution $T_n(\tau)$ with the corresponding eigenfunctions is given as the solution to equations \eqref{eq:forw_onebounddrift} and \eqref{eq:backw_onebounddrift} for all times $\tau$.

%Consider again a sample of size $M=2$, where $y \in (0,1,2)$. With $y=1$, initially $T_2(\tau=0)=2$, while all $T_n(\tau=0)$ with $n>2$ are zero. Since the boundary term is initially zero, $b=\theta$ in the backward diffusion equation (\ref{eq:backw_onebounddrift}). Another way to derive the boundary term is to note that it is equal to $\Pr(y=1\given \theta)=\theta$. Substituting these initial values into the inhomogeneous differential equations (\ref{eq:inhomogeneous}) results in the expansion for all $\tau$. The backward expansion converges to a constant distribution $\theta$ within the interval including zero but excluding one with $\tau\to\infty$.

%With $y=0$, we initially expand $x/(1-x)$ into a polynomial $\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{n+1}$ and determine the $T_n(x)$, while the boundary term is equal to $\Pr(y=0\given \theta)=\theta/2$. With $y=2$, the expansion is similar to that with $y=0$, but reflected around $x=1/2$, while the boundary term is equal to $\Pr(y=2\given \theta)=1-3\theta/2$.

\subsection{Example: reversible general mutation model with binomial likelihood}

\citet{Song12} already demonstrated the use of (modified) Jacobi polynomials to solve the backward diffusion equation (\ref{eq:backw_general}) with general bi-allelic mutation. Here, we apply the theory to a model with two populations and binomial likelihoods, \ie\ a jSFS analogous to the second example in the discrete case (subsection~\ref{section:discr_rev_general}). 

The modified Jacobi polynomials can be represented explicitly:
\begin{equation}
  R_n^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x)=\sum_{l=0}^n(-1)^l\frac{\Gamma(n-1+l+\theta)\Gamma(n+\alpha\theta)}{\Gamma(n-1+\theta)\Gamma(l+\alpha\theta)l!(n-l)!}x^l\,;
\end{equation}
the corresponding eigenvalues are $\lambda_n=n(n+\theta-1)$. 

Since a binomial distribution with sample size $M$ corresponds to a polynomial of order $M$ (which integrates to one) 
\begin{equation}
\Pr(y\given M,x)=\binom{M}{y}\,x^{y}(1-x)^{M-y}
=\binom{M}{y}\,\sum_{n=0}^{M-y} \binom{M-y}{n}\,x^{y+n}\,,
\end{equation}
it can be represented by an expansion into the modified Jacobi polynomials up to order $M$
\begin{equation}
\Pr(y\given M,x)=\sum_{n=0}^M c_n R_n^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x)\,.
\end{equation}
The orthogonality relationship of the modified Jacobi polynomials is
\begin{equation}
    \int_0^1 R_n^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x) R_m^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x)\, x^{\alpha\theta-1}(1-x)^{\beta\theta-1}\,dx=\delta_{n,m} \Delta_n^{(\alpha,\theta)}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{n,m}$ is the Kronecker delta and 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_n^{(\alpha,\theta)}=\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha\theta)\Gamma(n+\alpha\theta)}{(2n+\theta-1)\Gamma(n+\theta-1)\Gamma(n+1)}\,.
\end{equation}

At time $\tau=0$, the marginal likelihood of a single-population sample of size $M$ assuming mutation-drift equilibrium with parameters $\alpha$ and $\theta$ is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \Pr(y\given M,\alpha,\theta)
    &=\int_0^1 \Pr(y\given M,x) \pi(x,\alpha,\theta)\,dx\\
    &=\int_0^1 \binom{M}{y}\frac{\Gamma(\theta)}{\Gamma(\alpha\theta)\Gamma(\beta\theta)}\,x^{\alpha\theta+y-1}(1-x)^{\beta\theta+M-y-1}\,dx\\
    &=\binom{M}{y}\frac{\Gamma(\theta)}{\Gamma(\alpha\theta)\Gamma(\beta\theta)}
    \frac{\Gamma(y+\alpha\theta)\Gamma(M-y+\beta\theta)}{\Gamma(M+\theta)}\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Only the first eigenfunction is necessary to expand the equilibrium distribution:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \pi(x,\alpha,\theta)&=\frac{\Gamma(\theta)}{\Gamma(\alpha\theta)\Gamma(\beta\theta)}\,x^{\alpha\theta-1}(1-x)^{\beta\theta-1}\\
    &=\frac{1}{\Delta_0^{(\alpha,\theta)}}R_0^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x)\,x^{\alpha\theta-1}(1-x)^{\beta\theta-1}\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
It follows from the orthogonality relation that only the first term in the expansion $n=0$ contributes to the marginal likelihood, \ie\ the inner product
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \Pr(y\given M,\alpha,\theta)&=\int_0^1 c_0 R_0^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x) \pi(x,\alpha,\theta)\,dx\\
    &=\int_0^1 c_0 R_0^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x) \frac{1}{\Delta_0^{(\alpha,\theta)}}\,R_0^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x) x^{\alpha\theta-1}(1-x)^{\beta\theta-1}\,dx
    =c_0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

For two populations with sample sizes $M_1$ and $M_2$, the respective likelihoods $\Pr(y_1\given M_1)$ and $\Pr(y_2\given M_2)$ are similarly expanded into the modified Jacobi polynomials with coefficients $c_n^{(1)}$ and $c_m^{(2)}$, where the superscripts indicate the population. At time $\tau$ back in the past, we have
\begin{equation}
    \Pr(y_1\given x, M_1,\alpha,\theta,\tau)=
    \sum_{n=0}^{M_1} e^{-\lambda_n\tau}c_n^{(1)}R_n^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x)
\end{equation}
and similarly for the second population, such that the marginal likelihood is
%TODO: the indices for the populations are not consistent (super- vs subscripts)! But this may require change in the discrete case too!
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \Pr(y_1,y_2\given M_1,M_2,\alpha,\theta,\tau)&=
    \sum_{n=0}^{M_1}\sum_{m=0}^{M_2}\int_0^1 e^{-\lambda_n\tau}c_n^{(1)}R_n^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x)\\
    &\qquad\times e^{-\lambda_m\tau}c_m^{(2)} R_m^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x)\pi(x,\alpha,\theta)  \,dx\\&=
    \sum_{n=0}^{M}\int_0^1 e^{-2\lambda_n\tau}c_n^{(1)}c_n^{(2)} \left[R_n^{(\alpha,\theta)}(x)\right]^2\pi(x,\alpha,\theta)  \,dx\\
    &=\sum_{n=0}^{M}\frac{e^{-2\lambda_n\tau}c_n^{(1)} c_n^{(2)}\Delta_n^{(\alpha,\theta)}}{\Delta_0^{(\alpha,\theta)}}\,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the minimum of $M_1$ and $M_2$, since higher order terms contribute zero weight to the inner product. 

As an example, consider an ancestral population with a stationary beta allele frequency distribution parametrized by $\alpha$ and $\theta$; the ancestral population splits into two at some time in the past $\tau=s$. A joint site frequency spectrum is simulated from both populations (Table~\ref{jointSFScont}) at the present time $\tau=0$. The jSFS in Tables~1 and~2 are similar because scaled mutation rates and biases under which they are simulated are identical; however, the population size is set to $20$ for the discrete model instead of approaching infinity. As before, the likelihood of the population split time is readily calculated given the jSFS (Figure~\ref{twoPopcont}).

\section{Discussion}

In this article, we use forward and adjoint backward processes in discrete or continuous time to conveniently calculate probabilities of population allele frequencies of a bi-allelic locus, conditional on the SFS from the present. This may be used to infer trajectories of population allele frequencies in the past conditional on a sample from the present, or to calculate the marginal likelihood of a jSFS of splitting populations. In discrete time, the algorithm is a variant of the forward-backward algorithm and thus makes use of dynamic programming. In continuous time, orthogonal polynomials allow for even more convenient calculation. Furthermore, we introduce bi-allelic population genetic models with mutations only from the boundaries that provide us with time-reversible and irreversible transition matrices or kernels. The irreversible models are related to the infinite site \citep{Kimu69,Evan07} or Poisson-random-field models \citep{Sawy92} and have stationary distributions.

The discrete models involve repeated multiplications with a transition matrix of dimension $(N+1)\times(N+1)$, where $N$ is the haploid population size. For biological reasons, $N$ should be taken large to model the large (effective) population sizes usually encountered. For numerical reasons, however, $N$ should be small, because iteration of large matrices is time-consuming and numerical errors may accumulate. Mutation rates can be scaled to account for a reduction of $N$. Transition matrices may be diagonalized to speed up calculations. In any case, $N$ must be at least as big as the sample size $M$ to not lose information. A prior distribution must be assumed at some time in the past. If this distribution is taken as the stationary distribution of the transition matrix, calculations simplify. At present, a sample of size $M$ is given and a likelihood is assumed, \ie\ the probability distribution of a sample given the distribution of population allele frequencies $\x{0}$.

\citet{Zhao14} present a method that is also based on the iteration of a transition matrix (assuming the Wright-Fisher model) and allows for conditioning on the beginning and end states of the chain. They derive the marginal distribution of states intermediate in the chain and simulate trajectories. Extending this method to distributions instead of states (\ie\ the prior at the beginning and the likelihood at the end of the chain as considered in our case) requires additional considerations and diagonalizing the transition matrix seems to be necessary in all but the simplest cases. 

With continuous diffusion models, the use of orthogonal polynomials is convenient. The degree of the polynomials need not be higher than the sample size $M$, while the population size is assumed to converge to infinity, which fits the biological assumptions. Thus, this approach is numerically and biologically preferable. 

We apply the models to infer the conditional distribution of population allelic proportions backwards in time conditional on an SFS from the present. While some of the models use time-reversible Markov chains, the assumption of time-reversibility is not necessary.% and numerical advantages of time-reversibility are only slight.

Song and colleagues \citep{Song12,Stei13,Stei14,Zivk15} analyse self-adjoint continuous models generally with a Dirac delta function as a starting condition, instead of a prior distribution at $\tau=s$ and a likelihood at $\tau=0$ (see Appendix~A.1). Their assumptions require infinite series of polynomials to represent the starting Dirac delta function, instead of only up to the order of the sample size $M$, as with our assumptions. But since these authors also consider selection, which leads to eigenfunctions with infinite expansions on its own, this inconvenience is irrelevant. 

We note that an analysis involving iteration of moments \citep{Evan07,Zivk11} also provides a solution with similar initial conditions forward and backward in time. The model analyzed by these authors is identical to the irreversible boundary-mutation diffusion model presented here, where ancestral and derived alleles are differentiated (Subsection~\ref{section:irreversible_diffusion}). \citet{Zivk11} also discuss relations of that model to coalescence theory. 

Interestingly, \citet{Zhao13} also present an approach involving diffusion to calculate conditional trajectories that involves the product of solutions of the forward and backward equation. As with Song and colleagues, they consider a Dirac delta function as starting state and, additionally, also as a final state. Usually in population genetics, however, only a sample from the present is given, while the starting conditions are even less well defined. Thus our approach is better suited to population genetic data analysis. 

The demographic scenarios presented here (Fig.~\ref{diag}) are common in natural populations of fruit flies of the \textit{Drosophila} genus \citep[\eg][]{Li06,Zeng10a,Pool12}. Additionally, the abundance of population data for \textit{Drosophila} species makes them especially suitable for SFS and jSFS analysis under the described framework. Furthermore, the theory can be extended to more than two populations, \ie\ to phylogenetic inference. Our methods and algorithms can also be adjusted to an experimental setting with samples from multiple time points, as \eg\ in evolve-and-resequence experiments \citep{Kofl14}. In fact, \citet{Stei14} envision exactly such an application and analyze ancient DNA data. 
%CV: this method can also be used for ML estimation of effective population sizes! Should we elaborate and cite Agi's paper?

Generally, the methods and models we present in this article are simple, yet allow for maximum (marginal) likelihood analysis of SFS and jSFS from splitting populations, and for inference of evolutionary trajectories of population allelic proportions conditional on data.

\section{Appendix A.1}\label{section:Greens_function}

\citet{Song12} analyze self-adjoint differential equations, with a Dirac delta function $\delta(x-p)$ as starting point at $\tau=0$, rather than an arbitrary time $s$ in the past. Denote the eigenfunctions of the diffusion equation with the backward operator $\cal{L}^*$ with $B_i(x)$. Eq.~(5) of \citet{Song12} defines a ``propagator'' \citep[][chap.~19]{Bayi06}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:propagator}
    p(x\given p,\tau)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty e^{-\lambda_i \tau}\pi(x) \frac{B_i(x)B_i(p)}{\langle B_i(x)B_i(p) \rangle_{\pi}}
\end{equation}
as the solution of the diffusion equation with a starting state modeled by the Dirac Delta function $\delta(x-p)$. If the starting condition is not a particular state but, more usually, a distribution $\rho(p)$, the function
\begin{equation}\label{eq:solution}
    h(x\given p,\rho,\tau)=\int_0^1 p(x\given p,\tau)\rho(p)\,dp
\end{equation}
solves the diffusion equation. With the applications in this article, the infinite series in equations (\ref{eq:propagator}) and (\ref{eq:solution}) are more cumbersome than the direct route via the polynomials of degree $M$. 

%Note that the above approach with delta functions is the continuous analog to the use of the discrete forward models in \eg\ PoMo \citep{Schrempf2016}, with summation replacing the integral in equation (\ref{eq:solution}).
